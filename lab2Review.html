        <h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>
        <p>Adapted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>

        <p>
            <em>Augusta Ada King</em>, Countess of Lovelace (December 10, 1815 - November 27, 1852) is mainly known for having
            written a description of Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the analytical engine.

        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>
            Ada was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife, <em>Augusta Ada King</em>.
            In 1816, Annabella left Byron, taking 1-month old Ada with her.
            A few months later Byron signed the Deed of Separation and left England for good.
            He was never allowed to see either again.

            <em>Lady Byron</em> was very interested in mathematics (Lord Byron once called her "the queen of
            parallelograms"), which dominated her life, even after marriage.
            Her obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Lord Byron was one of the reasons
            why Annabella taught Ada mathematics at an early age. Ada was privately schooled in mathematics and science;
            one of her tutors was <em>Augustus De Morgan</em>.
            In 1835 Ada married <em>William King</em>, 8th Baron King, later 1st Earl of Lovelace.
            Her full name and title for most of her married life was The Right Honourable <em>Augusta Ada</em>, Countess of Lovelace.
            She is widely known in modern times simply as <em>Ada Lovelace</em>.

            Ada knew <em>Mary Somerville</em>, noted researcher and scientific author of the 19th century, who introduced her in turn to
            Charles Babbage in 1833. During a nine-month period in 1842-1843, Ada translated
            for Babbage Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's memoir on Babbage's newest proposed machine,
            the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of Notes which specified in complete detail
            a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the Engine, recognized by historians as the world's first
            computer program. Biographers note, however, that the programs were written by Babbage himself, and Lovelace
            simply found a mistake in the program for calculating Bernoulli numbers and sent it back for amendment.
            The evidence and correspondence between Lovelace and Babbage indicate that he wrote all of the programs
            in the notes appended to the Menebrea translation. Her prose acknowledged some possibilities of the machine
            which Babbage never published, such as speculating that "the Engine might compose elaborate and scientific
            pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent."

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>On December 10, 1980, (Ada's birthday), the U.S. Defense Department approved the reference manual for their new computer programming language, called "Ada".</li>
            <li>The U.S. Department of Defense Military Standard for Ada (MIL-STD-1815) was assigned a number to commemorate the year of her birth.</li>
            <li>She is one of the main characters in the alternate history novel The Difference Engine by Bruce Sterling
                and William Gibson, which posits a world in which Babbage's machines were mass produced and the computer age started a century early.</li>
            <li>Lord Byron's Novel by John Crowley is a pastiche of a novel supposedly by Byron (in real life he did begin writing one, but is not known to have completed it),
                discovered after his death by his daughter, edited and with commentary by her.</li>
            <li>Her image can be seen on the Microsoft product authenticity hologram stickers.</li>
